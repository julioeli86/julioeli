# Data Mining and Decision Analysis based on Haberman's Data

The attached Haberman's dataset (*HabermansSurvivalData.xlsx*) contains cases from a study that was conducted between 1958 and 1970 at the University of Chicago's Billings Hospital on the survival of patients who had undergone surgery for breast cancer.

# Data

This data set is named **"Haberman's Survival Data"** because it was first used in a research paper by S. J. Haberman.

This data set has 306 records. The following are the attributes.

•	***Age of patient at time of operation (numerical)***

•	***Patient's year of operation (year - 1900, numerical)***

•	***Number of positive axillary nodes detected (numerical)***

− Survival status (class attribute)

•	***1 = the patient survived 5 years or longer***

•	***2 = the patient died within 5 year***

# Objective

The objective of the project is to find the best performing classification model to predict if a patient will survive five years or longer after the surgery.

# Response

The data set named "Haberman's Survival Data" was analyzed using the following models: 

•	***Decision tree***

•	***kNN***

•	***Naive Bayesian***

•	***ANN***

•	***SVM***

•	***Ensemble learners (Voting, Bagging and Random Forest)***

Some of the models were analyzed using the numerical to binomial operator as allowed by Rapid Miner. Others were analyzed without the numerical to binomial operator. A detailed list of what operators were analyzed in each case is presented in Table 1.
