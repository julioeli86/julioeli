The attached Haberman's dataset (HabermansSurvivalData.xlsx) contains cases from a study that was conducted between 1958 and 1970 at the University of Chicago's Billings Hospital on the survival of patients who had undergone surgery for breast cancer.

This data set is named "Haberman's Survival Data" because it was first used in a research paper by S. J. Haberman.

This data set has 306 records. The following are the attributes.

•	Age of patient at time of operation (numerical)

•	Patient's year of operation (year - 1900, numerical)

•	Number of positive axillary nodes detected (numerical)

− Survival status (class attribute)

•	1 = the patient survived 5 years or longer

•	2 = the patient died within 5 year

The objective of the project is to find the best performing classification model to predict if a patient will survive five years or longer after the surgery.

To conduct this data mining project, you will use RapidMiner, Python, or R. Please follow the data mining methodology you learned in this course to conduct the project.

In order to find the best performing model, you need to try all the appropriate algorithms that you have learned in this course and compare their performance. For each model, take screenshots of the data mining process and the results. Interpret the results. Put all the screen shots and your answer in one Word document. Submit the RapidMiner process file or Python / R source code.
